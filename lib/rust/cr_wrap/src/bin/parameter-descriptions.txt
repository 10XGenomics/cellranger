Section: [gene-expression]

    reference <path>
        Required. Path of folder containing 10x Genomics-compatible genome
        reference.
    probe-set <path>
        Required, Fixed RNA profiling only. Probe set CSV file, declaring probe
        constructs and associated barcodes.
    filter-probes <true|false>
        Optional, Flex only. Include all non-deprecated probes
        listed in the probe set reference CSV file. Probes that are predicted
        to have off-target activity to homologous genes are excluded from
        analysis by default. Setting filter-probes to false will result in UMI
        counts from all non-deprecated probes, including those with predicted
        off-target activity, to be used in the analysis. Probes whose ID is
        prefixed with DEPRECATED are always excluded from the analysis.
        Default: true.
    r1-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 1 of gene expression libraries to
        this length before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 1.
    r2-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 2 of gene expression libraries to
        this length before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 2.
    chemistry <auto>
        Optional. Assay configuration. NOTE: by default the assay configuration
        is detected automatically, which is the recommended mode. You usually
        will not need to specify a chemistry. Options are: 'auto' for
        autodetection, 'threeprime' for Single Cell 3', 'fiveprime' for
        Single Cell 5', 'SC3Pv1' or 'SC3Pv2' or 'SC3Pv3' or 'SC3Pv4' for Single Cell 3'
        v1/v2/v3/v4, 'SC5P-PE' or 'SC5P-R2' or 'SC5P-R2-v3' for Single Cell 5',
        paired-end/R2-only, 'SC-FB' for Single Cell Antibody-only 3' v2 or 5',
        'SFRP' for singleplex FRP and 'MFRP' for multiplex FRP. To analyse GEX
        portion of multiome data, chemistry must be set to 'ARC-v1'. Default: auto.
    expect-cells <int>
        Optional. Expected number of recovered cells.
    force-cells <int>
        Optional. Force pipeline to use this number of cells, bypassing cell
        detection. Default: detect cells using EmptyDrops.
    emptydrops-minimum-umis <int>
        Optional. Minimum number of UMIS per barcode to consider after the initial cell calling.
        Default: 500.
    no-secondary <true|false>
        Optional. Disable secondary analysis, e.g. clustering. Default: false.
    create-bam <true|false>
        Required. Enable or disable BAM file generation.
        Setting --create-bam=false reduces the total computation time and the size of
        the output directory (BAM file not generated).
        We recommend setting --create-bam=true if unsure.
        See https://10xgen.com/create-bam for additional guidance.
    check-library-compatibility <true|false>
        Optional. This option allows users to disable the check that evaluates
        10x Barcode overlap between libraries when multiple libraries are
        specified (e.g., Gene Expression + Antibody Capture). Default: true.
    include-introns <true|false>
        Optional. Set to false to exclude intronic reads in count. Including
        introns in analysis is recommended to maximize sensitivity.
        Default: true.
    min-assignment-confidence <float>
        Optional. The minimum estimated likelihood to call a sample as tagged
        with a Cell Multiplexing Oligo (CMO) instead of "Unassigned". Users may
        wish to tolerate a higher rate of mis-assignment in order to obtain more
        singlets to include in their analysis, or a lower rate of mis-assignment
        at the cost of obtaining fewer singlets. By default, this value is 0.9.
        Contact support@10xgenomics.com for further advice.
    cmo-set <path>
        Optional. The default CMO reference IDs are built into the Cell Ranger
        software and do not need to be specified. However, this option can be
        used to specify the path to a custom CMO set CSV file, declaring CMO
        constructs and associated barcodes. See CMO Reference section for
        details.
    barcode-sample-assignment <path>
        Optional. Absolute path to a barcode-sample assignment CSV file that
        specifies the barcodes that belong to each sample. Also applicable to
        cell hashing with Antibody Capture.
    tenx-cloud-token-path <path>
        Optional. The path to the 10x Cloud Analysis user token used to enable cell
        annotation. If not provided, will default to the location stored
        through cellranger cloud auth setup.
    cell-annotation-model <string>
        Optional. Valid model names can be viewed by running
        `cellranger cloud annotation models` or on the 10x Genomics Support site
        (https://www.10xgenomics.com/support). If "auto", uses the default model
        for the species. If not provided, does not run cell annotation.

Section: [feature]

    reference <path>
        Required for Feature Barcode libraries, otherwise optional. Feature
        reference CSV file, declaring Feature Barcode constructs and associated
        barcodes.
    r1-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 1 of Feature Barcode libraries to
        this length before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 1.
    r2-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 2 of Feature Barcode libraries to
        this length before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 2.
    min-crispr-umi <int>
        Optional. Minimum CRISPR UMI threshold. Default: 3.

Section: [vdj]

    reference <path>
        Required for Immune Profiling libraries. Path of folder containing
        10x-compatible VDJ reference.
    inner-enrichment-primers <path>
        Optional. If inner enrichment primers other than those provided in the
        10x kits are used, they need to be specified here as a text file with
        one primer per line.
    r1-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 1 of VDJ libraries to this length
        before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 1.
    r2-length <int>
        Optional. Hard trim the input Read 2 of VDJ libraries to this length
        before analysis. Default: do not trim Read 2.
