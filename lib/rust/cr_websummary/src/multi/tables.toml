# Definitions for tables that appear in the multi web summary.
#
# - Add a new section for each table
# - `entries` under the table control the order in which columns appear
# - Each entry needs to have a [table_name.entry] section containing header/type/help etc
# - help is optional
#
# ## Alerts
# Each metric could be associated to multiple alerts. Alerts can be customized based on context.
# There are two specific use cases in this toml:
# - `library_cell_metrics.cell_associated_partitions` has an additional alert for LT chemistry
# - `gex_sample_mapping_metrics.confidently_mapped_antisense` has a different alert based on whether
#   we have a targeted sample or not.
