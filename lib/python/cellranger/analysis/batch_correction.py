    """Compute batch effect score on an aggregated dimension-reduced matrix.

    The batch effect score quantifies the degree of separation between groups of barcodes (batches).
    For each barcode, the fraction of its k-nearest neighbors with the same batch id is calculated.
    Local batch scores are computed by scaling and shifting the same-batch fractions to be strictly
    less than the number of batches and have expectation equal to 1 under identical batches.
    Finally, the average of these local batch scores is computed to obtain the overall batch effect
    score. A batch score of 1 indicates no separation between batches, and a batch score equal to
    the number of batches indicates perfect separation. A batch score less than 1 may occur in rare
    cases and is consistent with no batch separation.

    Args:
        dimred_matrix (np.ndarray[tuple[int, int], np.dtype[np.float64]]): dimension reduced matrix.
            Rows are samples and columns are features (e.g. principal components)
        batch_ids (np.ndarray[int, np.dtype[np.string_]]): 1-D array of batch IDs. Must have at
            least 2 observations per batch
        knn_frac (Optional[float], optional): Sets k in the k-nearest neighbors calculation to a
            fraction of the total barcodes (after subsampling to max_num_bcs). Defaults to 0.01.
        max_num_bcs (Optional[int], optional): Maximum number of barcodes to use. Larger data sets
            will be subsampled. Defaults to 10000.
        knn_neighbors (Optional[int], optional): Use a fixed k rather than knn_frac
