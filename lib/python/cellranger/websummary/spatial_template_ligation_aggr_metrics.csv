Many of the reads were not assigned to tissue covered spots. This could be caused by high levels of ambient RNA resulting from inefficient permeabilization, because the incorrect image was used, or because of poor tissue detection. The latter case can be addressed by using the manual tissue selection option through Loupe. <i>Ignore this alert if you manually selected a subset of the tissue in the capture area, such as a single core punch in a TMA</i>.",alert_warn_detail,0.3,0.5,alert_warn_detail,alert_warn_detail,acceptable,targeted,gt,percentage,TRUE,FALSE,Low Fraction Reads in Spots,alert_warn_name,"The fraction of valid-barcode, confidently-mapped-to-probeset reads with tissue-associated barcodes."
