# Baseline Metrics
filtered_bcs_conf_mapped_barcoded_reads_cum_frac,TRUE,Square Calling,Fraction Reads in Squares Under Tissue,"Ideal > 75%. Application performance may be affected. Many of the reads were not assigned to tissue covered squares. This could be caused by high levels of ambient RNA resulting from inefficient permeabilization, because the incorrect image was used, or because of poor tissue detection.
